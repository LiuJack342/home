                Over the years, many different types and interpretatiosn of the rubik&#39;s cube have sufaced, ranging from cubes with larger sufaces, up to entirely different 3-D shapes, and confusing unorthodox moving parts. With so many rubik&#39;s cube variations, once you learn how to complete the 3x3, there will be even more fun to be had!

                <p>
                    The 3x3 is the &#34;original&#34; rubik&#39;s cube, as it is the initial cube that was created by Erno Rubik. This cube has 6 sides, like a cube should, made of six different colors. The goal of this puzzle is to twist and turn the layers of the cube, to match all the sides to have a single color on each side.

                <h2>The 2x2</h2>
                <p>
                    The two-by-two rubik&#39;s cube is a much simpler brain teaser, compared to the &#34;original&#34; three-by-three. Like with the 3x3, the goal of this puzzle is to make it so that each of the six sides is reverted to its original state - where each side features only one color. This cube is much simpler to learn and solve than the 3x3, and it is highly recommended for those who don&#39;t have the patience to learn the 3x3.

                <h2>The 4x4</h2>
                <p>
                    The four-by-four Rubik&#39;s cube is just a step up from the &#34;original&#34; 3x3 rubik&#39;s cube. Like the 3x3 rubik&#39;s cube, to solve this puzzle, you need to twist the sides of the cube, so that you can bring the cueb back to its original state - when all sides sides each boast a single color. However, the 4x4 cube is a step up from the 3x3, making it even harder to master. To master this cube, you will need to recall skills learned from the 3x3, and bring them together with new ones, to solve this puzzle. It is a lot of fun to solve it, whether self-taught or having found the solution on the internet.

                <h2>The 5x5</h2>
                <p>
                    The five-by-five Rubik&#39;s cube is again, a step up from the 4x4 rubik&#39;s cube, requiring advanced solving methods to solve. This cube boasts 150 smaller square sides, all of which need to be realigned to solve the cube. As most can tell, this cube is quite the tricky puzzle to solve, requiring skills learned from the previous cubes! This cube is not something to be taken lightly, so it is advised that new cubers not attempt it, but for any exeperienced, avid cubers, this can be quite a fun puzzle to attempt.

                <p>
                    The Rubik&#39;s Pyramid may look simple to the eye, but it is a great challenge. This puzzle changes its shape with turns, offering a confusing yet fun challenge. Although it differs from the normal rubik&#39;s cube and its other cube-shaped variants, it still retains the same puzzle-solving thrill. It may be easier than most other variants, but it still deserves your attention, as without the proper mindset, this puzzle can still be quite the challenge.
