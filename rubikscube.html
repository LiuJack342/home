                The 3x3 rubik&#39;s cube is a cube, with its six sides covered in a three-by-three pattern of smaller, colored squares. The starting position of the puzzle is the &#34;solved&#34; state of the puzzle, where all the sides have a single color on them, and by rearanging the cube, the sides can start to collect other colored squares. To solve the rubik&#39;s cube, you need to twist and turn the sides of the puzzle, so that the cube can go back to its solved state. The rubik&#39;s cube is one of the world&#39;s most popular puzzles, and its difficulty and its interesting shape are iconic traits of the Rubik&#39;s cube.

                The rubik&#39;s cube is a cube-shaped puzzle, designed by Hungarian teacher and puzzle enthouiaste called Erno Rubik in 1974. In the beginning, the cube was sold in toy stores in budapest before appearing throughout toy stores in Hungary, sold under the name of the &#34;Magic Cube&#34;. However, it took a few more years before it could be sold worldwide, due to political issues. It wasn&#39;t until 1980, where along with a change in name to become the &#34;Rubik&#39;s cube&#34; it began to sell world wide, where it took the world by storm. The rubik&#39;s cube gained immense popularity, very quickly, and propagating its popularity across the globe.

               During this period of glory for the rubik&#39;s cube, it saw immense popularity worldwide. However, many people would play around with the cube for a few minutes, tinker with it, but end up giving up on the cube shaped puzzle, and few would solve the cube. However, there were those who would chose to continue onwards, and these people would go on to not only solve the cube, but to improve their skills and solve the cube at staggering speeds.

                Soon after, the first ever &#34;Rubik&#39;s Cube World Championship&#34; would take place in Budapest in 1982, where Mihn Thai, an competitor from the United States, would go on to win first place, and become the first ever Rubik&#39;s Cube World Champion. However, the Rubik&#39;s Cube&#39;s fame would soon drop, and by 1983, what people have thought was a &#34;simple fad&#34; would soon die off, as interest dissapated. It was only two decades later with the introduction of the internet, when competitions were once again ebing planned, and when the World Cube Association would be founded.
