            <p>
                The rubik's cube was created by a hungarian teacher and puzzler called Erno Rubik. In 1974, 
                Rubik created the first functional "Magic cube", as he called it at the time, and he went on to
                obtain a hungarian patent for his "Magic cube" just the next year in 1975. His initial prototype
                was a "cube" made out of wood, with cut corners. After creating his initial prototype, he
                encounterd the problem of actually solving the cube. Putting the cube back into its original shape
                was extremely difficult - he didn't even know if the cube could be reverted to normal! Being the
                first to attempt to solve the cube, he had no point of reference, and it took Rubik an entire
                month to solve the cube.

            <h2>Early history</h2>
            
            <p>
                It was only years later, in 1977, when the first "Magic Cubes" were sold to the public. The
                earliest cubes were sold in Budapest toy shops, before spreading throughout Hungary. The "Magic
                Cube" couldn't be sold anywhere else at the time due to political reasons, as Hungary was a
                communist state at the time. However, the cubes were eventually allowed out of the country in 
                1979, and along with a name change to the "Rubik's Cube", the Rubik's cube was now sold in toy 
                stores around the world in 1980.

                The Rubik's Cube was a great success worldwide, as there were more than a hundred million cubes
                sold, in just a few years of its release. Eventually, the comical speed at which the cubes were
                selling declined just a few years later. The six-sided magical cube had spread its influence 
                across the globe, but at the time, people had got used to its intriguing sides of the difficult
                puzzle, and it seemed that the Rubik's cube fad had gone out.
