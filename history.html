                The rubik's cube was created by a hungarian teacher and puzzler called Erno Rubik. In 1974, 
                Rubik created the first functional "Magic cube", as he called it at the time, and he went on to
                obtain a hungarian patent for his "Magic cube" just the next year in 1975. His initial prototype
                was a "cube" made out of wood, with cut corners. After creating his initial prototype, he
                encounterd the problem of actually solving the cube. Putting the cube back into its original shape
                was extremely difficult - he didn't even know if the cube could be reverted to normal! Being the
                first to attempt to solve the cube, he had no point of reference, and it took Rubik an entire
                month to solve the cube.

                It was only years later, in 1977, when the first "Magic Cubes" were sold to the public. The
                earliest cubes were sold in Budapest toy shops, before spreading throughout Hungary. The "Magic
                Cube" couldn't be sold anywhere else at the time due to political reasons, as Hungary was a
                communist state at the time. However, the cubes were eventually allowed out of the country in 
                1979, and along with a name change to the "Rubik's Cube", the Rubik's cube was now sold in toy 
                stores around the world in 1980.

                The Rubik's Cube was a great success worldwide, as there were more than a hundred million cubes
                sold, in just a few years of its release. Eventually, the comical speed at which the cubes were
                selling declined just a few years later. The six-sided magical cube had spread its influence 
                across the globe, but at the time, people had got used to its intriguing sides of the difficult
                puzzle, and it seemed that the Rubik's cube fad had gone out.

                During the Rubik Cube's initial burst of popularity, people have been captivated by the cube, trying to solve it. Although many have tried but have given up, eventually, people have found ways to solve it. Afterwards, people have tried to get faster and faster with the cube, trying to challenge themselves to achieve faster times. These people were eventually called speedcubers, who try to solve the cube as fast as possible.

                The first "rubik's Cube World Championship" took place in Budapest, Hungary in 1982, taking place just a few years after the initail world wide release of the Rubik's cube. This competition featured many competitiors from different countries, including many now-famous faces, and in the end, a competitor from the United States, Minh Thai, won the competition, winning a gold-plated rubik's cube and becoming the first ever Rubik's Cube World Champion. However, after this first world championship, there wouldn't be another one for a few decades, as the rubik's cube's popularity dropped.

                Two decades after the first Rubik's Cube World Championship, competing in speedcubing competitions started to regain attention, the introduction of the internet helped to connect cubers from around the world, to organise another world championship. This prompted a competition to be held in Toronto, Canada in 2003, where many people participated, to win the second world championship. This time, the winner was declared to be an individual called Dan Knights, who won with an average time of 20.00 seconds. This event was a great success for the speedcubing community as it sparked interest in more competitions, leading to the formation of the World Cube association

                The World Cube association was founded in 2004, as a means to properly organise and standardize competitions. It was an organisation created by two individuals, which continued to grow to encompass thousands of volunteers. This organisation is a non-profit organisation that aims to properly organise Rubik's cube competitions, for the sake of improving competitions. Since then, it has been active in hosting and organising numerous rubik's cube competitions and events.

                Today, the rubik's cube has become one of the world's most well-known puzzles, that has become a mainstream toy in many parts of the world. The rubik's cube hasn't lost any of its charm, despite "loosing" its difficulty, with so many solutions accessible online. Meanwhile, the speedcubing community has also been doing very well, as the World Cube association continues to host competitions around the globe.
