                Since the dawn of the rubik's cube's creation, people have always wanted to get faster with the cube. For many, touching and playing around with the cube for a few moments would be enough to get them stumped. For few, they would find methods, one way or another, to solve the cube and bring their minds to rest. However for some, they would continue going the extra few steps, honing their skills, eventually achieving times that would impress the whole world. These dedicated few are "speedcubers", whose objective is to solve the cube and its variations, as fast as possible.

                Since the rubik's cube's initial appearance on toy store shelves, it has been regarded as a very difficult puzzle, to which countless individuals have given up solving. However, at the beginning, once people discovered how to solve it, many felt the need to solve the cube with more speed and efficiency. In addition, due to the international sensation that the cube had became during its international debut in 1980, there was also an influx of new cubers, all trying their hand in the new speedcubing scene

                The first ever "Rubik's Cube World Championship" took place in Budepest, the rubik's cube's home town, in 1982. The competition featured competitiors chosen from 19 countries, chosen from smaller national-level competitions, all of which were competing for the gold. Many now-famous individuals in the speedcubing community were competing as well. In the end, the United States competitor, Minh Thai, was eventually demeed the winner of the competition with a time of 22.41 seconds, winning a gold-plated rubik's cube, as well as being named the "first Rubik's Cube World Champion".

                After the rubik's cube's initial success in the 1980s, it quickly died off a bit after a few years. This had also applied to the speedcubing community, where there had not been another rubik's cube world championship for over two decades. Soon, however, with the introduction of the internet, speedcubers around the world were able to talk to each other about their interests, and this garnered attention towards another competition. Because of this, the following rubik's cube world championship took place in Toronto in the year 2003. The winner of the competition, Dan Knights, won with an average time of 20.00 seconds, and became the second ever "Rubik's Cueb World Champion". The event was a great success, and it spurred more attention towards speedcubign competitions, eventually leading to the creation of the World Cube Association.

                The Idea of the World Cube Association started as interest towards speedcubing and speedcubing competitions began to grow, following the 2003 Toronto World Championship, with the purpose of better regulation and recording of competitions. The first version of the WCA regulations was created in August of 2004, just a year after the initial hype of the 2003 Toronto championship. The organisation began with its co-founders Ron van Bruchem and Tyson Mao, before they started to reruit even more volunteers as delegates to organise and monitor cubing competitions. Over time, the demand for speedcubing competitions continued to spread, as the art of speedcubing traveled. This meant that the WCA had to expand and grow, having gone through numerous structural changes in the past. Even so, the WCA's goal remains the same - to help organise more rubik's cube events.

                In the present day, the WCA and the speedcubing community has an immense presence everywhere, as it has accumulated support and members from across the globe. The community has been slowly growing throughout the years, and it has reached a great size. To this day, the speedcubing community remains active even after a couple decades, and competitions occur regularly around the world.
